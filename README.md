# Raspberry_Pi_Basic
What is a Raspberry Pi? Raspberry pi is the name of the “credit card-sized computer board” developed by the Raspberry pi foundation, based in the U.K. It gets plugged in a TV or monitor and provides a fully functional computer capability. It is aimed at imparting knowledge about computing to even younger students at the cheapest possible price. Although it is aimed at teaching computing to kids, but can be used by everyone willing to learn programming, the basics of computing, and building different projects by utilizing its versatility. 

Raspberry Pi is developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation in the United Kingdom. The Raspberry Pi is a series of powerful, small single-board computers.

Raspberry Pi is launched in 2012 and there have been several iterations and variations released since then.

Various versions of Raspberry Pi have been out till date. All versions consist of a Broadcom system on a chip (SoC) with an integrated ARM-compatible CPU and on-chip graphics processing unit (GPU).

The original device had a single-core Processor speed of device ranges from 700 MHz to 1.2 GHz and a memory range from 256 MB to 1 GB RAM.

To store the operating system and program memory Secure Digital (SD) cards are used. Raspbian OS which is a Linux operating system is recommended OS by Raspberry Pi Foundation. Some other third party operating systems like RISC OS Pi. Diet Pi, Kali, Linux can also be run on Raspberry Pi.

## Used:

It also provides a set of general purpose input/output pins allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IOT).

## Raspberry Pi model -

There have been many generations of raspberry Pi from Pi 1 to Pi 4.
There is generally a model A and model B.
Model A is a less expensive variant and it trends to have reduce RAM and dual cores such as USB and Ethernet.

## List of Raspberry pi models and releases year:

pi 1 model B - 2012 
pi 1 model A - 2013 
pi 1 model B+ -2014 
pi 1 model A+ - 2014 
Pi 2 Model B - 2015
Pi 3 Model B- 2016
Pi 3 Model B+ -2018
Pi 3 Model A+ -2019
Pi 4 Model A - 2019
Pi Model B - 2020
Pi 400 - 2021


Specs of the Computer: - The computer has a quad-core ARM processor that doesn’t support the same instruction as an X86 desktop CPU. It has 1GB of RAM, One HDMI port, four USB ports, one Ethernet connection, Micro SD slot for storage, one combined 3.5mm audio/video port, and a Bluetooth connection. It has got a series of input and output pins that are used for making projects like - home security cameras, Encrypted Door lock, etc. 

Versatility of Raspberry Pi: - It is indeed a versatile computer and can be utilized by people from all age groups, it can be used for watching videos on YouTube, watching movies, and programming in languages like Python, Scratch, and many more. As mentioned above it has a series of I/O pins that give this board the ability to interact with its environment and hence can be utilized to build really cool and interactive projects. 

Examples of projects: - It can be turned into a weather station by connecting some instruments to it for check the temperature, wind speed, humidity etc... It can be turned into a home surveillance system due to its small size; by adding some cameras to it the security network will be ready. If you love reading books it can also become a storage device for storing thousands of eBooks and also you can access them through the internet by using this device.
